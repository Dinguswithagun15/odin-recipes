    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A steak pie is a traditional meat pie served in Britain. It is made from stewing steak and beef gravy, enclosed in a pastry shell. Sometimes mixed vegetables are included in the filling. The dish is often served with "chunky chips".</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1kg braising steak, diced</li>
        <li>2 onions, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</li>
        <li>2 beef stock cubes mixed with 600ml boiling water</li>
        <li>375g sheet of ready-rolled puff pastry</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the filling, heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Heat half the oil in a large casserole dish, brown the meat really well in batches, then set aside. Add the onions adding a drizzle more oil, then cook on a low heat for 5 mins until coloured.</li>
        <li>Scatter over the flour, stirring until the flour turns brown. Tip the meat and any juices back into the pan along with the ketchup and give it all a good stir. Pour over the stock, season, and bring to a simmer then cover with a lid and put in the oven for about 2 hrs, until the meat is tender. The filling can be made up to three days ahead and chilled or frozen for up to three months.</li>
        <li>To make the pie, heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Tip the filling into a 24-26cm rimmed pie dish and brush the rim of the dish with some yolk. Unravel the pastry, drape over the dish and use a knife to trim and press the edges against the side of the dish. Re-roll your trimmings to make a decoration if you like. Brush the pie heavily with egg yolk. Make a few little slits in the centre of the pie and bake for 40 mins until golden. Leave to stand for a few minutes before serving.</li>
